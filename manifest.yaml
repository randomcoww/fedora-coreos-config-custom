  # We don't support root on NFS, so we don't need it in the initramfs. It also
  # conflicts with /var mount support in ignition because NFS tries to mount stuff
  # in /var/ and then ignition can't cleanly unmount it. For example:
  # https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/blob/1856ae95c873a6fe855b3dccd0144f1a96b9e71c/modules.d/95nfs/nfs-start-rpc.sh#L7

# This thing is crying out to be pulled into systemd, but that hasn't happened

# basically right now it doesn't exist on s390x.
# Anyways, it was requested by the Red Hat perf team for RHCOS, so we have it here.
